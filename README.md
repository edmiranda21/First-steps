# First-steps in Python with JetBrains Academy
I take the JetBrains Academy to learn python for beginner and here i will post the results. This is my first steps in python to build a very small proyects. I had worked with some python scripts in the past that I didnt have to do anything complicated than set directory and work with csv files. Here i will post small projects with the plataffroms JetBrains Academy.

## Zookeper
A proyect called ZooKeeper I need to demonstrate the skills learned. 
The project just ask you to print an animal of a zoo, the user introduce a number and i needed to check to animal that correspond to that number and print it.
The project keep asking for a number and printing, but when the user introduce "exit" the program stop with a print of "See you Later!".  


## Bot
A project i demostrate the skills learned, this are functions and loops.
The exercise try to make a chatbot which you enter some information to know your name, guess your age, count numbers and a little multiple choice test.
