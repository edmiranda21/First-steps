# First-steps in Python
I take the JetBrains Academy to learn python for beginner and here i will post the results. This is my first steps in python to build a very small proyects. I had worked with some python scripts in the past that I didnt have to do anything complicated than set directory and work with csv files. Here I will post small projects.

## Zookeper
A proyect called ZooKeeper I need to demonstrate the skills learned. 
The project just ask you to print an animal of a zoo, the user introduce a number and I needed to check to animal that correspond to that number and print it.
The project keep asking for a number and printing, but when the user introduce "exit" the program stop with a print of "See you Later!".  


## Bot
A project I demostrate the skills learned, this are functions and loops.
The exercise try to make a chatbot which you enter some information to know your name, guess your age, count numbers and a little multiple choice test.


## Loan calculator
The proyect can be use to calculate different financial parameters such as: loan, number of paymets, annuity payment or differentiate payments. To make the
calculations I use the following topics: basic data types, variables, functions, elif statements, loops and python libraries. The python libraries used
are: math (Mathematical functions), argparse and sys module. The user need to input via command line the parameters and the values to get a answer.
