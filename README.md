# First-steps in Python with JetBrains Academy
I take the JetBrains Academy to learn python for beginner and throught a proyect called Zookerper I need to demonstrate the skills learned. 
This is my first steps in python to build a very small proyect. I had worked with some python scripts in the past that I didnt have to do anything complicated than 
set directory and work with csv files.
The project just ask you to print an animal of a zoo, the user introduce a number and i needed to check to animal that correspond to that number and print it.
The project keep asking for a number and printing, but when the user introduce "exit" the program stop with a print of "See you Later!".
